# Beginner Python Projects ðŸŽ¯

This repository is a collection of my beginner-friendly Python projects.  
I built these to practice programming fundamentals (with a little guidance) while having fun with small games and utility applications.  
Curently in my first year pursuing Electronics and Communications Engineering with a specialization in Artifical Intelligence.
